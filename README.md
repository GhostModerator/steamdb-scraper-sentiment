This study explores integrating sentiment analysis into churn forecasting for online multiplayer
games, building on the research of Rahman et al. (2024). While traditional churn models rely
solely on player count data, this study investigates whether incorporating player sentiment scores
derived from Steam reviews can improve the prediction of player churn. Focusing on three of
Steamâ€™s most popular multiplayer competitive games (CS 2, Dota 2, and PUBG), a Vector
Autoregression (VAR) model was used to analyze the dynamic interplay between player
sentiment and engagement. In addition to replicating prior models, this study extends them to a
broader set of games, demonstrating the practical value of sentiment-driven forecasting for game
developers to anticipate and mitigate player churn.
